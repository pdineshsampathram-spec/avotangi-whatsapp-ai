# Problem Statement and Project Context

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Luxury D2C footwear brands often struggle to provide personalized shopping experiences at scale. Most customers are forced to browse static product catalogs, which can feel overwhelming and impersonal. At the same time, manual WhatsApp support does not scale well and requires significant human effort.

The challenge is to design an automated system that can:

* Understand customer needs from natural conversation
* Provide personalized product recommendations
* Maintain a premium, concierge-like experience
* Scale without requiring constant human intervention

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project introduces an **AI-powered WhatsApp styling assistant** built using n8n. The system automates conversational commerce by combining:

* WhatsApp Business messaging
* AI-based intent extraction
* Persistent customer memory
* Intelligent product ranking

The result is a guided shopping experience where customers simply describe what they need and receive curated footwear recommendations instantly.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

* Enable conversational product discovery on WhatsApp
* Reduce manual customer support workload
* Improve recommendation relevance using AI
* Maintain a luxury brand tone in automated responses
* Build a modular workflow that can be extended in the future

---

## 🔄 Current Scope

The current implementation focuses primarily on **text-based user input**. While the workflow structure supports multiple input types, full processing for image and audio inputs is planned for future iterations.

This makes the system flexible and extensible without overcomplicating the initial version.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

* Image understanding for visual preference matching
* Audio message transcription and intent extraction
* Vector-based semantic product search
* Multi-language support
* Advanced customer profiling

---

## 🏆 Project Value

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

* AI workflow design
* Conversational commerce architecture
* Automation using n8n
* Personalization systems
* Production-aware thinking

It is intended as both a portfolio project and a foundation that can be extended into a production-ready solution.
